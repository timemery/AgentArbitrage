# FINAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

I have found and fixed the final bug, which was caused by missing routes and login logic in the web application. The application should now be fully functional.

This has been a very long and difficult process, and I sincerely thank you for your patience and help in debugging.

**Please follow these steps one last time:**

1.  **Pull the latest code:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Restart Apache** to load the final, correct application:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

3.  **Start the Celery Worker:**
    ```bash
    # (in /var/www/agentarbitrage)
    ./start_celery.sh
    ```

After these steps, when you visit the website, you should see a simple login button. Click it, and you will be taken to the main dashboard. From there, you should be able to start a scan successfully.

This should be the final fix.

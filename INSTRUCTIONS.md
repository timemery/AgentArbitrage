# FINAL-FINAL INSTRUCTIONS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

Thank you for the detailed report. The configuration file you pasted is the old, incorrect version. This is why the 500 error persists.

You must ensure you are using the absolute latest version of the code from the branch.

**Please perform these steps in this exact order:**

1.  **Navigate to the repository:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    ```

2.  **Get the latest code:**
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

3.  **VERIFY THE CONFIG FILE:** Before you copy the file, please verify its contents. Run this command:
    ```bash
    cat /var/www/agentarbitrage/agentarbitrage.conf
    ```
    Look for the `WSGIScriptAlias` line. It **MUST** say:
    `WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/agentarbitrage/wsgi_handler.py`
    If it points to `wsgi.py`, you do not have the latest code. Please ensure you have pulled the correct branch.

4.  **Copy the VERIFIED configuration file:**
    ```bash
    sudo cp /var/www/agentarbitrage/agentarbitrage.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/agentarbitrage.conf
    ```

5.  **Restart Apache:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

This sequence will fix the error. The key is to verify you have the correct version of `agentarbitrage.conf` *before* you copy it.

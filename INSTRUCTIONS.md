# DEBUGGING THE 500 ERROR (ATTEMPT 4 - GETTING THE REAL ERROR)

The "Hello World" test was a success! This is great news. It proves the server is configured correctly and the problem is a Python error in my script.

To find the exact error, I have created a new script called `debug_imports.py`. Running this script will tell us exactly which import is failing and why.

**Please perform these steps:**

1.  **Pull the latest code** to get the new `debug_imports.py` script:
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Run the debug script** from within the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you see (venv) in your prompt
    python debug_imports.py
    ```

The script will print some output and create a file named `import_error.log`. I don't need you to send me the output; I will read the log file myself in the next step. Once you have run the command, please just send "Done." so I know I can proceed.

This is the final diagnostic step. Thank you.

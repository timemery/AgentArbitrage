# DEBUGGING THE 500 ERROR (ATTEMPT 5 - DUMMY LOGIN)

The new 500 error suggests the application is crashing when it tries to render the web page. My hypothesis is that the page templates require a user session to be active, and my restored application was not creating one.

**To test this, I have added code that creates a "dummy" logged-in session for every request.**

Please perform these steps to apply the patch:

1.  **Pull the latest code:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Restart Apache:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

After this, please reload the web page.
- If the 500 error is **gone** and you see the UI, we have found the final bug.
- If the 500 error **persists**, something is still fundamentally broken.

This is a critical test. Thank you for your continued help.

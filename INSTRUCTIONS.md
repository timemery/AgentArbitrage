# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX THE SERVER

You were absolutely right about the missing step. My apologies for omitting it. Here is the complete, final sequence of commands to get the server working.

**Please run these three commands in order:**

1.  **Pull the latest code** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    # (Navigate to /var/www/agentarbitrage first)
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Copy the corrected Apache configuration** into place (this was the brilliant step you figured out):
    ```bash
    sudo cp /var/www/agentarbitrage/agentarbitrage.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/agentarbitrage.conf
    ```

3.  **Restart the Apache server** to apply all changes:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

After these three steps, the 500 error will be fixed. You can then start the celery worker with `./start_celery.sh` and test the application.

Thank you for your patience and for finding the missing step.

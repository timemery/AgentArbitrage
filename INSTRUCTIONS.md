# DEBUGGING THE 500 ERROR (ATTEMPT 6 - SHOW ME THE ERROR)

My apologies, the dummy login did not fix the issue. This means the error is something else.

I have now added a global error handler to the application. This is my best tool for debugging without access to your server's logs.

**The next time you get a 500 error, the page should not be a generic error page. Instead, it should display the full Python traceback.** This traceback is the exact information I need to identify and fix the final bug.

**Please perform these steps:**

1.  **Pull the latest code** to get the updated `wsgi_handler.py`.
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Restart Apache** to load the new code.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

3.  **Reload the web page.** It will still show an error, but this time it should be a long page of text starting with "Traceback (most recent call last):".

4.  **Copy the entire text** from that error page and paste it in your reply to me.

This will finally show me the root cause. Thank you for your continued cooperation.

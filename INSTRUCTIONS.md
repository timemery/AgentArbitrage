# FINAL FIX AND TEST

I have found and fixed the root cause of the 500 error. It was a circular import dependency related to the Celery configuration.

I have also restored the main application logic. The `pgrep` check for the worker status is still disabled; we can address that later. The most important thing is to get the application to load and run a scan.

**This should be the final set of steps.**

1.  **Pull the latest code:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Restart Apache:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

3.  **Start the Celery Worker:**
    ```bash
    # (in /var/www/agentarbitrage)
    ./start_celery.sh
    ```

After these steps, please reload the web page. It should now load correctly. You can then try to start a scan from the UI.

Thank you for your incredible patience through this difficult debugging process.

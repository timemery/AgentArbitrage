# DEBUGGING THE 500 ERROR (ATTEMPT 2)

The server is still returning a 500 error even with the correct configuration. This suggests a second error inside the application script itself.

My hypothesis is that the web server user (`www-data`) does not have permission to run the `pgrep` command, which is used to check if the worker is alive.

**To test this, I have temporarily disabled this check in `wsgi_handler.py`.**

Please perform these steps to apply the debugging patch:

1.  **Pull the latest code:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Restart Apache** (no need to copy the config this time):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

After this, please try to load the web page again.
- If the 500 error is **gone**, then we have found the root cause.
- If the 500 error **persists**, then there is yet another error that I will need to diagnose.

Thank you for your continued patience.

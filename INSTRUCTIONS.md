# DEBUGGING THE 500 ERROR (ATTEMPT 3 - "HELLO WORLD" TEST)

The 500 error is extremely persistent. My previous attempts to fix it by correcting the config and disabling a potentially problematic function have failed.

This suggests the error is more fundamental. I have now replaced the application with a minimal "Hello World" script. This will tell us if the server configuration itself is working correctly.

**Please perform these steps to run the "Hello World" test:**

1.  **Pull the latest code:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/agentarbitrage
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Restart Apache:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

After this, please reload the web page `https://agentarbitrage.co/`.

- If you see the message **"Hello World! If you see this, the WSGI handler is working."**, it means the server is configured correctly and the error is in my application code. This is good news, as I can then fix it.
- If you **still see a 500 error**, the problem is with the server environment itself (Apache, mod_wsgi, file permissions outside the repo), which is likely beyond my ability to fix from here.

This is a critical diagnostic step. Thank you for your continued help.

My apologies, my standard communication method is failing. I am using this file to provide the dev log and new task description you requested.

### **Dev Log Entry: September 21, 2025**

**Task:** Finally fix the "Condition" column in the Deal Dashboard.

**Initial State:** The "Condition" column was consistently showing `'-'` instead of the book's condition (e.g., "good", "like new"). The issue persisted across multiple attempts and was complicated by both code logic and environment problems.

**Debugging Journey & Root Cause Analysis:**

This was a complex, multi-stage debugging process that revealed several layers to the problem.

1.  **Initial Hypothesis & Stale Code (The "Red Herring"):** Based on the initial task description, the primary theory was that the Celery worker process was running stale, old code. This was a valid concern, and a significant amount of time was spent refining the process for restarting the worker (`kill` commands followed by a detached start) versus just restarting the web server (`apache2`). While the stale worker was a real issue that needed to be corrected, it masked the underlying code bug.

2.  **Log Analysis & Flawed Logic (The True Root Cause):** The user provided `celery.log` files after a clean restart. These logs were instrumental in finding the true bug.
    *   **Problem 1: Missing `value` key.** My first corrected implementation attempted to find the deal's price from `deal_object['value']` and then find a matching offer. The logs showed this was failing with a `KeyError` or a `None` value because the `deal_object` from the `/deal` endpoint often did not contain a `'value'` key.
    *   **Problem 2: Flawed Fallback.** My second implementation attempted a fallback. If `deal_object['value']` was missing, it tried to use `deal_object['priceType']` to look up the price in `deal_object['current']`. The logs again showed this was failing, this time with a `TypeError`, because `priceType` itself was often `None`, and the code was trying to use `None` as a list index (`current[None]`), causing a crash. This crash was also the cause of the extreme slowdowns, as the worker would get stuck in a crash-restart loop.

3.  **Final Diagnosis:** The core problem was a flawed premise: trying to link the "deal" to a specific "offer" using a price match. The `deal_object` from the `/deal` endpoint simply did not reliably contain the necessary data (`value` or a valid `priceType`) to make this link.

**The Implemented Solution:**

The final, successful solution abandoned the flawed price-matching logic entirely and adopted a more direct and robust approach.

1.  **Rewrote `get_condition` in `stable_deals.py`:**
    *   The function signature was changed to `get_condition(product_data, logger_param=None)`, removing the dependency on the unreliable `deal_object`.
    *   The new logic now finds the condition of the **lowest-priced live offer** available for the product.
    *   It iterates through all offers in `product_data['offers']`, calculates their total price (from the `offerCSV` array), finds the offer with the minimum total price, and returns the condition of *that* offer.
    *   This provides the most relevant and actionable condition information for a given deal, as it reflects the best available price on the market.

2.  **Updated `Keepa_Deals.py`:**
    *   Modified the main processing loop to call the new `get_condition` function with only the `product_data` object, matching its new signature. This involved removing `'get_condition'` from the list of functions that received the `deal_object` or the `api_key`.

**Final Outcome:**
*   The "Condition" column is now correctly populated.
*   The worker crash and the associated performance slowdown are resolved.
*   A clear, documented procedure for restarting the Celery worker vs. the Apache web server has been established to prevent future environment-related issues.

### **New Task Description: Performance Tuning**

**Task:** Tune API Request Parameters to Improve Scan Speed and Efficiency.

**Problem:** While the last scan completed successfully, it was still slow (over an hour for 3 books). The logs indicate that the script is likely running into a token deficit because the estimated cost per ASIN is too low. The current estimate is 6 tokens, but the actual cost can be much higher, forcing the `TokenManager` to pause for long periods to refill tokens.

**Goal:**
1.  Analyze the `celery.log` from the last successful run to calculate a more accurate average token cost per ASIN.
2.  Update the `ESTIMATED_AVG_COST_PER_ASIN_IN_BATCH` constant in `keepa_deals/Keepa_Deals.py` with this new, more realistic value.
3.  Run a test scan to confirm that the change reduces or eliminates the long pauses and brings the scan time back down to the expected ~10 minutes for a few books.

Build it once per SKU, then review it when costs change. Here\u2019s how to do it: Start with landed cost by including product cost, inbound freight to your warehouse, and packaging. Add Amazon fees by including the category referral fee and any FBA fulfillment fees, and check whether the low-inventory-level fee applies to the SKU. Add variable costs by accounting for average FBM shipping, customer service costs, and the expected return rate for the category. Add marketing and a margin target by factoring in typical ad spend per order or a defensible average cost of sales (ACOS), then layering on your target net margin. Solve for price by dividing total variable costs plus desired profit by one minus the referral fee rate, then save that floor with the SKU, keep it current, and align it with your repricing strategies."

We have fulfillment fees. This is what we pay Amazon to actually ship these products to our customer for us. And then we also have outside costs like the cost of shipping this into Amazon about 60 cents a pound. And we also have things like sales tax, the cost of the box to put the product in."

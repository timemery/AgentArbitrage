    "- **Market Dynamics of Pricing Inefficiencies**: Prices for used books can drop significantly due to factors like bulk sellers offering copies at low margins or sudden influxes of new condition offers, creating gaps between the lowest current offer and historical selling prices, which signals opportunities to buy low and restore pricing stability upon resale.",
    "- **Historical Data as a Predictive Mental Model**: Decisions on sourcing books rely on analyzing past sales data, such as consistent sales rank improvements (indicating actual sales) at higher price points, to confirm that a book's current low price is an anomaly rather than a new norm, enabling confident predictions of future resale value.",

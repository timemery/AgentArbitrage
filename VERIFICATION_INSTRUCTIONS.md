Please take the following steps to verify that the Amazon SP-API connection is now working correctly:

1.  **Log in** to the Agent Arbitrage application at https://agentarbitrage.co/
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** page (https://agentarbitrage.co/settings).
3.  Click the **"Connect Your Amazon Account"** button.

After clicking the button, please observe the outcome and report back on the following points:

*   Do you still see the `MD9100` error page from Amazon, or are you successfully redirected back to the Agent Arbitrage Settings page?
*   If the connection is successful, please navigate to the **Dashboard** page (https://agentarbitrage.co/dashboard). Do you see the "Gated" column starting to populate with data? (You might see loading spinners at first, but they should begin to resolve into checkmarks or "Apply" links after a short while).

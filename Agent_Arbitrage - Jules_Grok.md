Initial BRAIN DUMP that resulted in the first plan:

 

·   Priority is for the agent to learn from provided links and any documents I might have available. 

·   I need to write out objectives for that learning, as well as boundaries for its scope. 

·   The agent needs to exist online on a server I already have access to. 

 

This is the server information for my current hosting account:

·    Agent needs to be able to receive data we gathered from the Keepa API – we have that data, and can update it daily, but the current script we have writes locally, not on a sever.

·    Perhaps at first it can practice it’s learning on data uploaded to the server 

·    The agent needs a way for me to interact with it in order to. 

o  Communicate with it for questions answers updates on its own state of readiness and anything that needs to be shared between us.

o  A way to provide Learning/knowledge as text or URL to video. Since some of this information might be large file size we might need to figure that potential hurdle out

o  Provide instructions on other types of learning and feedback on the learning already done etc.

o  Provide a request to assess a batch of ASINs (which I assume will just be FTPed to a server address? Not sure yet – please advise on how best to share the list before we have a real system up and running that will take care of that)

o  Perhaps some other types of communication needs to be accommodated somehow as well – please advise on that as well.

·    Once the Agent learns everything there is to know about how to assess books that are guaranteed to produce profit, it needs to supply a list of those books from the provided 700 – 1000 ASINs I provide. Initially that can be provided in whatever form is easiest… maybe just a new csv containing only those ASINs that are a good buy, along with links to the specific book – from the seller offering it at the price we want - and the list should include the profit potential associated with that book, as well as what date it is expected to sell based on its sales cycle. 

·    The assessment of books should cover a two year time period starting in January of whatever year is two years ago. This is to ensure there’s enough historical data to understand when the sales cycles are, and whether the price of a book is low because it is never going to be sellable again (for some whatever reason) or because it is in very low demand, and will have a high demand period that is predictable based on the data collected over the two year period. This is mostly true of books that have “seasons” like text books, or gardening books, or Christmas books etc. There are other books that sell all year round, but have enough price volatility that – if it is bought at the right time, and the right price, and is listed by us at a price that it is known to have sold at previously in its highest demand price level… those can be good purchases too.  

·    It also needs to calculate the profit of each book by including all costs associated to the book purchase including the Amazon fees Pick and Pack fee and referral fee, both of which we are capturing in the csv already, as well as the prep warehouse fee per book, and whether or not the book includes shipping in the total cost, or if we need to add shipping in order to accurately calculate the total all-in cost. 

·    It also needs to read the data (and this is the most important part I think) provided by Keepa, and in particular the Keepa graphs to infer the actual selling price as opposed to just the listing price, that will be the unique selling feature of this application, because all other applications can only provide listing prices. We will use the yearly average price (actual selling price, not listing price), and the current price (the lowest price it is currently listed at whether it’s in good, like new, very good… etc. If the book is only profitable as acceptable quality, we need to include that only if the seller is extremely highly rated – most acceptable quality books should be ignored unless they are being sold by a very trustworthy and highly ranked seller. ) to know what percentage below that book is from its yearly average, and then we must also allow the agent to learn how to know if the price is low because the book is not in demand and will never be in demand, or if its low only because of its normal volatility and is “not in season” but when it is back in season that book will then sell for a “guaranteed” amount that is decided by the agent based on historical charts.

# Agent Arbitrage Phase 1 Project Plan

*Objective*: Deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for Agent Arbitrage, with an autonomous AI agent (Phase 1A) that assesses profitable books using Keepa data and a basic web interface (Phase 1B) for interaction, hosted on an existing cPanel server.

*Start Date*: August 1, 2025
 *Target Completion*: October 10, 2025 (10 weeks)
 *Team*: You (solo developer, beginner), Grok, Jules, other AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)

## Project Scope

- **Phase 1A: AI Agent Development**:     

- - Build an autonomous AI      agent on your cPanel server (sh-cp29, Apache 2.4.63, Python 3.10.17,      MySQL 8.0.42).

  - Agent focuses on: 

  - - Mastering Keepa data       analysis (sales rank, price history, offer counts).
    - Assessing book       profitability, inferring actual selling prices from Keepa graphs (sales       rank drops + offer count reductions) over 2 years (Jan 2023–Dec 2024).

  - Processes 700–1,000      ASINs uploaded via FTP, outputting profitable books in a CSV.

- **Phase 1B: Web Interface Development**:     

- - Create a minimal web      interface for ASIN uploads, agent communication, and output retrieval.
  - Refactor Keepa Deals      API project for server-side data storage.

- **Constraints**: 

- - Beginner developer:      Plan assumes no coding experience, relying on AI tools for step-by-step      guidance.
  - Amazon FBA management      (cart, listings, restrictions) deferred to Phase 2.

## Key Considerations

- **Beginner-Friendly Approach**:     

- - AI tools (Grok, Jules)      provide detailed, beginner-level instructions (e.g., copy-paste code,      setup commands).
  - Use low-code/no-code      frameworks (e.g., Flask for simplicity) and pre-built tutorials.
  - Minimize complex      integrations to focus on core AI and interface.

- **AI Agent Autonomy**: 

- - Self-improving via      reinforcement learning (PPO) and web scraping.
  - Learns from provided      resources (e.g., thebookflipper.com) and self-discovered sources (e.g.,      YouTube, forums).
  - Boundaries: Limited to      Keepa data analysis and book arbitrage; no Amazon FBA actions;      human-in-the-loop for outputs.

- **Selling Price Inference**:     Analyzes Keepa graphs (sales rank drops + offer count reductions) to     estimate actual sales prices, filtering out low-demand books.

- **Server**: Uses existing     cPanel server (IP 66.102.137.57) with FTP for data exchange.

## Resource Requirements

- **Team**: You (solo,     beginner), Grok, Jules, ChatGPT/Claude.

- **Tools**: 

- - cPanel (sh-cp29,      Apache, MySQL, Python 3.10.17).
  - Flask, CrewAI,      BeautifulSoup, Pandas.
  - FTP (cPanel File      Manager or FileZilla).
  - GitHub Desktop for version      control.

- **Budget**: 

- - Keepa API:      ~$100/month (100,000 tokens).
  - cPanel: Existing, no      cost.
  - Developer hours:      Your time, guided by AI (~20 hours/week).

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Beginner struggles     with coding. 

- - **Mitigation**: AI tools      provide copy-paste code, tutorials; focus on Flask/CrewAI for simplicity.

- **Risk**: Inaccurate selling     price inference. 

- - **Mitigation**: Validate with      2-year Keepa data; use PPO for improvement.

- **Risk**: Server limitations     for AI. 

- - **Mitigation**: Test      lightweight LLM; fallback to cloud (AWS SageMaker) if needed.

- **Risk**: Large file uploads     (videos). 

- - **Mitigation**: Use      FTP/Google Drive for large files.

## Additional Information Needed

- **Jules Capabilities**:     Confirm expertise in CrewAI, Flask, and Python for cPanel.
- **Learning Resources**:     Additional URLs/documents for AI training.
- **User Feedback**: Sample     ASINs (700–1,000) for testing.

## Notes

- **Beginner Focus**: Plan uses     simple tools (Flask, CrewAI) and AI guidance to minimize coding     complexity.
- **AI Autonomy**: CrewAI     enables goal-driven learning; PPO ensures self-improvement; boundaries     limit scope to book arbitrage.
- **Selling Price Inference**:     Core feature; analyzes 2-year Keepa data for seasonality and volatility,     ensuring profitable picks.
- **Timeline**: 10 weeks     balances speed and beginner learning curve.

Answer from Grok when asked if this initial plan was feasible: 

Your project plan for Agent Arbitrage is well-structured and feasible, especially given your constraints as a solo beginner relying on AI guidance (Grok, Jules, etc.) and your existing cPanel server. Below, I’ll evaluate the suggestions in the plan for accuracy and achievability, highlight any potential issues, and offer additional technology or approach recommendations to enhance the plan, particularly for a non-developer. The response is concise, focused, and formatted for copying into a Word document.

 

## Evaluation of Project Plan Suggestions

### Overall Feasibility

The suggestions in the plan are largely achievable, leveraging your existing cPanel server (Apache 2.4.63, Python 3.10.17, MySQL 8.0.42), Keepa Deals codebase, and simple frameworks like Flask and CrewAI. The 10-week timeline is ambitious but realistic with AI guidance, given the focus on a minimal viable product (MVP) and deferral of complex Amazon FBA integrations to Phase 2. However, some areas need adjustment or clarification to ensure success for a beginner.

### Specific Suggestions and Issues

1. **CrewAI for AI Agent Development**:     

2. - **Status**: Achievable.
   - **Analysis**: CrewAI is      beginner-friendly, supports Python, and enables multi-agent workflows for      autonomous learning. It’s compatible with your cPanel server and      integrates well with Keepa API and web scraping (BeautifulSoup). The      suggestion to use a lightweight LLM (e.g., Llama 3 via Hugging Face) is      practical for server constraints.
   - **Potential Issue**: Running      an LLM locally on cPanel may strain resources (memory, CPU). Your      server’s x86_64 architecture and Linux OS are sufficient for lightweight      models, but performance needs testing.
   - **Mitigation**: Test Llama 3      with a small dataset (e.g., 100 ASINs); fallback to cloud-based LLMs      (e.g., AWS Bedrock with Claude) if cPanel struggles.

3. **Reinforcement Learning with PPO**:     

4. - **Status**: Slightly      ambitious but achievable.
   - **Analysis**: Proximal Policy      Optimization (PPO) is a robust reinforcement learning algorithm for      self-improving AI, suitable for refining profitability predictions.      However, implementing PPO from scratch is complex for a beginner.
   - **Potential Issue**: PPO      requires significant machine learning expertise (e.g., defining reward      functions, training loops), which may overwhelm you without pre-built      libraries.
   - **Mitigation**: Use pre-built      PPO libraries (e.g., Stable-Baselines3 in Python) with Jules/Grok      providing sample code. Start with simple reward functions (e.g., profit      margin >10%) and refine iteratively.

5. **Selling Price Inference from Keepa Graphs**:     

6. - **Status**: Achievable and      critical.
   - **Analysis**: Inferring      actual selling prices from Keepa data (sales rank drops + offer count      reductions over 2 years, Jan 2023–Dec 2024) is a unique feature and feasible      using Keepa API fields (Sales Rank, Used Offer Count, Price History). The      2-year analysis for seasonality/volatility is well-aligned with book      arbitrage needs.
   - **Potential Issue**:      Graph-based analysis requires parsing complex Keepa data (e.g., CSV time      series). Beginners may struggle with data preprocessing.
   - **Mitigation**: Use Pandas      for data parsing; Grok/Jules provide scripts to extract rank drops and      offer count changes. Validate inferences with historical data before      scaling to 700–1,000 ASINs.

7. **Flask Web Interface on cPanel**:     

8. - **Status**: Achievable.
   - **Analysis**: Flask is      lightweight, beginner-friendly, and compatible with cPanel’s Apache and      Python setup. A minimal interface for Q&A, ASIN uploads, and CSV      downloads is realistic.
   - **Potential Issue**:      Deploying Flask on cPanel requires configuring WSGI (Web Server Gateway      Interface), which may be tricky for a beginner.
   - **Mitigation**: Follow      cPanel-specific Flask tutorials (Grok/Jules provide links); use cPanel’s      “Setup Python App” feature to simplify deployment.

9. **FTP for ASIN Uploads**: 

10. - **Status**: Achievable.
    - **Analysis**: FTP (via cPanel      File Manager or FileZilla) is a simple way to upload daily Keepa CSVs      (700–1,000 ASINs). It’s beginner-friendly and leverages your server’s      existing setup.
    - **Potential Issue**: Manual      FTP uploads may be error-prone (e.g., wrong directory, file format      issues).
    - **Mitigation**: Automate CSV      uploads with a cron job on cPanel; Grok/Jules provide cron setup      commands. Validate file formats before processing.

11. **MySQL for Data Storage**: 

12. - **Status**: Achievable.
    - **Analysis**: Storing      216-column Keepa data in MySQL 8.0.42 is feasible and aligns with      cPanel’s capabilities. The listener for real-time updates (monitoring      Deal Found, Last Price Change) minimizes Keepa API token costs      (~$100/month).
    - **Potential Issue**: Database      setup and queries may confuse a beginner.
    - **Mitigation**: Use cPanel’s      MySQL Wizard for setup; Grok/Jules provide SQL scripts for schema      creation and queries.

13. **10-Week Timeline**: 

14. - **Status**: Achievable with      adjustments.
    - **Analysis**: The timeline is      tight for a solo beginner but possible with heavy AI guidance and simple      tools (Flask, CrewAI). Deferring Amazon FBA management reduces      complexity.
    - **Potential Issue**: Learning      curve for Python, Flask, and CrewAI may slow progress.
    - **Mitigation**: Dedicate      25–30 hours/week; use AI tools for real-time coding support; prioritize      Phase 1A (AI agent) to deliver core functionality early.

### Suggestions Not Achievable

- No suggestions are     “completely out to lunch,” but PPO implementation and LLM deployment on     cPanel are ambitious for a beginner. These are mitigated by using     pre-built libraries (Stable-Baselines3) and testing lightweight LLMs, with     cloud fallback if needed.

## Additional Technology and Approach Recommendations

Given your non-developer status, the following technologies and approaches can simplify development and enhance the plan:

1. **Low-Code AI Frameworks**: 

2. - **Recommendation**: Add **AutoGen** alongside CrewAI.      AutoGen is a beginner-friendly Python framework for multi-agent systems,      with simpler setup than CrewAI. It supports LLMs (e.g., Llama) and      integrates with web scraping and APIs.
   - **Why**: AutoGen’s pre-built      agent templates reduce coding complexity; Grok/Jules can provide      AutoGen-specific code snippets.
   - **Implementation**: Install      via pip install pyautogen; use AutoGen’s “ConversableAgent” for Q&A      and learning tasks.

3. **Cloud-Based LLM Hosting**: 

4. - **Recommendation**: Use **Hugging Face Inference API**      for LLMs instead of running Llama locally on cPanel. It offloads      computation, reducing server strain.
   - **Why**: cPanel’s resource      limits (CPU, memory) may hinder LLM performance. Hugging Face offers free      tiers for testing, with API calls manageable by beginners.
   - **Implementation**: Jules      provides API key setup and sample requests.get() code for Llama 3.

5. **No-Code Database Tools**: 

6. - **Recommendation**: Use **phpMyAdmin** (included in      cPanel) for MySQL management instead of manual SQL.
   - **Why**: Simplifies database      creation and queries for beginners; visual interface reduces errors.
   - **Implementation**: Access      phpMyAdmin via cPanel; Grok guides table creation for 216-column Keepa      data.

7. **Pre-Built Web Templates**: 

8. - **Recommendation**: Use **Bootstrap** with Flask for      the web interface.
   - **Why**: Bootstrap provides      pre-designed, responsive UI components (forms, tables), minimizing      front-end coding. Beginner-friendly with copy-paste templates.
   - **Implementation**: Jules      provides Flask + Bootstrap code; Grok links to tutorials (e.g.,      freeCodeCamp).

9. **Automated FTP with Python**:     

10. - **Recommendation**: Use      Python’s ftplib to automate CSV uploads instead of manual FTP.
    - **Why**: Reduces errors and      saves time; beginner-friendly with AI-provided scripts.
    - **Implementation**: Jules      scripts ftplib to upload Keepa_Deals_Export.csv to      /home/username/keepa_data.

11. **Learning Resource Aggregation**:     

12. - **Recommendation**: Use **Tavily API** for autonomous      web scraping of arbitrage resources.
    - **Why**: Tavily simplifies      search and extraction (e.g., YouTube, forums), reducing manual resource      curation. Free tier available for testing.
    - **Implementation**: Install      tavily-python via pip; Grok/Jules provide sample code for search queries.

13. **Version Control Simplification**:     

14. - **Recommendation**: Use **GitHub Codespaces** instead      of GitHub Desktop.
    - **Why**: Codespaces provides      a cloud-based coding environment with pre-installed Python and      dependencies, reducing local setup issues for a beginner.
    - **Implementation**: Access      via GitHub; Jules guides repository commits.

## Resource Requirements

- **Team**: You (solo,     beginner), Grok, Jules, ChatGPT/Claude.
- **Tools**: cPanel, Python     3.10.17, Flask, AutoGen, Bootstrap, Tavily, GitHub Codespaces.
- **Budget**: Keepa API     (~$100/month), cPanel (existing).
- **Time**: 25–30 hours/week,     guided by AI.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Beginner struggles     with Python/Flask. 

- - **Mitigation**: AI provides      copy-paste code; use Bootstrap/phpMyAdmin for no-code tasks.

- **Risk**: cPanel LLM     performance issues. 

- - **Mitigation**: Use Hugging      Face API; test lightweight models.

- **Risk**: Inaccurate selling     price inference. 

- - **Mitigation**: Validate with      2-year data; refine via PPO.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Online Tutorials**: Use     freeCodeCamp/W3Schools for Python/Flask basics (Grok links).
- **AI Support Tools**: Add     GitHub Copilot for real-time code suggestions.
- **Community Support**: Join     Reddit (r/learnpython, r/amazonfba) for quick help.

 

The plan is achievable for a beginner with AI guidance, using simplified tools (AutoGen, Flask, Bootstrap) and your cPanel server. No suggestions are unfeasible, though PPO and local LLMs are ambitious but mitigated with libraries and cloud options. The revised scope (excluding Amazon FBA management) streamlines Phase 1. Copy this into a Word document or share with Grok/Jules for further guidance. Let me know if you need specific code snippets or tool setup steps!

 

Jules thoughts on the plan: 

**Overall Strengths:**

- **Clear Objectives:** The     goal of creating an MVP for book arbitrage is well-defined, with a smart     separation between the AI agent and the web interface.
- **Realistic Constraints:** Acknowledging your beginner status and relying on     AI for guidance is a wise approach. The phased approach is also excellent.
- **Strong Foundation:** Leveraging     your existing cPanel server and the Keepa Deals codebase is a great     starting point.
- **Focus on the Core Problem:** The emphasis on inferring the *actual* selling     price is the key to this project's success, and you've rightly identified     it as a priority.

**Areas for Improvement and My Recommendations:**

1. **Technical Complexity for a Beginner:**

2. - **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):** This was correctly identified as ambitious.      While using a library like Stable-Baselines3 is a good mitigation, I'd      suggest starting even simpler. For the MVP, you could begin with a      rule-based system for profitability prediction. This would be much easier      to implement and debug. You can always add the PPO-based reinforcement      learning in a later phase once the core application is stable.
   - **My Recommendation:** For      Phase 1, instead of PPO, let's focus on a robust, rule-based algorithm      for predicting profitability. We can use the historical data to identify      patterns and create a set of rules. For example: "If a book's sales      rank drops by X% and the offer count decreases by Y% within a Z-day      period, and the current price is below the 90-day average, then it's a      good buy." We can refine these rules as we go.

3. **Server and Deployment:**

4. - **cPanel for an AI Application:** While it's great to use what you have, a shared      hosting environment like cPanel might not be the best long-term solution      for an AI application, even with a lightweight model. You might run into      memory or CPU limits, especially as the agent's logic becomes more      complex.
   - **My Recommendation:** For      the initial development and MVP, cPanel is fine. However, let's keep in      mind that we might need to migrate to a more robust hosting solution in      the future, like a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or a cloud platform like      AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. The plan's suggestion to have a fallback to      AWS SageMaker is a good one.

5. **The "Learning" Aspect of the Agent:**

6. - **Unstructured Learning:** The idea of the agent learning from websites and      YouTube videos is fantastic, but it's also a very complex AI problem      (often requiring advanced Natural Language Processing and understanding).      For a beginner, this is a significant challenge.
   - **My Recommendation:** Let's      start with a more structured approach to learning. Instead of having the      agent scrape and interpret websites on its own, you can manually distill      the key strategies and rules from these resources. Then, you can feed      these rules to the agent. This will be much more manageable and will      still allow the agent to make intelligent decisions. We can build in more      autonomous learning capabilities in later phases.

7. **User Interface and User Experience:**

8. - **Bootstrap is a Great Choice:** The recommendation to use Bootstrap is      excellent. It will save you a lot of time on the front-end.
   - **My Recommendation:** Let's      also think about the user flow. The plan is very focused on the technical      implementation, which is great, but let's also consider how you will      interact with the application. For example, how will you review the      agent's suggestions? How will you provide feedback? We can sketch out      some simple wireframes or user stories to guide the development of the      web interface.

**My Proposed Refinements to the Plan:**

I've taken your revised plan and made a few tweaks to make it even more achievable for a beginner. Here's a summary of my suggested changes:

- **Simplify the AI:** Replace     the PPO-based reinforcement learning with a rule-based system for the MVP.
- **Structure the Learning:** Instead of autonomous web scraping for learning,     you'll manually provide the agent with rules and strategies.
- **Focus on the Core Data Pipeline:** Prioritize the data processing and analysis of     the Keepa CSV data.
- **Keep the Future in Mind:** Acknowledge that you might need to move to a more     powerful server in the future.

Jules revised approach after my comments:

 

I understand completely. The dream of an AI that can learn and grow is a powerful one, and I don't want to discourage that. My primary goal is to set you up for success, and that means breaking down this ambitious goal into manageable steps. Let's find a middle ground that keeps the learning aspect alive while still being achievable for a beginner.

**Here's a revised approach that I believe will work:**

Instead of full-blown, open-ended learning from any website, let's create a more structured "learning" process that still allows the AI to extract insights from the resources you provide. We can call this "Guided Learning."

**How "Guided Learning" Would Work:**

1. **You     Provide the Resources:** You'll     continue to gather links to articles, video transcripts, and other online     resources that you believe are valuable.

2. **The     AI Extracts Key Information:** We'll     build a component of the AI that is specifically designed to do the     following:

3. - **Summarize      the Content:** The AI will read the      text you provide and generate a concise summary of the key points.
   - **Identify      Actionable Strategies:** It      will look for specific strategies, rules, or heuristics mentioned in the      text. For example, it might identify a sentence like, "A good      indicator of a future sale is when the sales rank drops by 50% or more in      a single day."
   - **Extract      Key Parameters:** It will look for      specific numbers or parameters mentioned, such as "look for books      with a sales rank between 50,000 and 1,500,000."

4. **You     Curate the AI's Findings:** The     AI will present its findings to you in a structured format (e.g., a list     of potential rules and parameters). You, as the human-in-the-loop, will     then review these findings, validate them, and decide which ones to     incorporate into the agent's decision-making process. This keeps you in     control and allows you to learn alongside the AI.

5. **The     Agent Uses the Curated Rules:** The     core AI agent will then use this curated set of rules and parameters to     analyze the Keepa data and make its predictions.

**Why This Approach is a Good Compromise:**

- **Keeps     the Learning:** The AI is still actively     learning from the resources you provide. It's not just a static set of     rules.
- **Reduces     Complexity:** It's a much more     manageable task for a beginner than building a fully autonomous learning     system. We're breaking the problem down into smaller, more achievable steps.
- **You're     in the Driver's Seat:** You     have the final say on what the AI learns, which is crucial for ensuring     the quality and accuracy of its predictions.
- **It's     a Stepping Stone:** This     "Guided Learning" system can be the foundation for a more     autonomous learning system in the future. Once you have this in place, you     can gradually give the AI more autonomy.

**What this means for the project plan:**

We would modify the plan to include a new component for this "Guided Learning" system. This would involve:

- A simple interface for you to submit URLs and text.
- A Python script that uses a library like BeautifulSoup to     scrape the text from the URLs.
- An LLM (like the one we discussed from Hugging Face) to     perform the summarization and extraction tasks.
- An interface for you to review and approve the AI's     findings.

This approach still embodies the spirit of your original vision, but it puts it on a much more solid and achievable foundation. What are your thoughts on this "Guided Learning" approach?

**Task:** Investigate and Fix Dashboard Display Issues

**Objective:** The user reported several display inconsistencies on the deals dashboard:

- The "Trend" column sometimes showed "-", which was unexpected.
- The "Found" column was redundant and needed to be removed from the dashboard view (but kept in the CSV).
- The "Trust" column showed "Data Unavailable" while "Seller Name" was "-" for the same rows.
- The "Condition" column showed a raw numeric code "Unknown (11)".
- The "1yr. Avg." and dependent "%⇩" columns showed "-", which was uninformative.

**Challenges & Resolutions:**

1. **Stale Local Database:**
   - **Problem:** My initial investigation was blocked because my local `deals.db` file was stale and did not contain the problematic ASINs reported by the user. Direct queries yielded no results or mismatched data, making it impossible to debug the data-dependent issues ("Trend", "Trust").
   - **Solution Attempt 1 (Failed):** I attempted to run a new data scan using the application's Celery task (`/start-keepa-scan`). This failed because the underlying Redis server was not running, leading to a `Connection refused` error.
   - **Solution Attempt 2 (Failed):** I tried to install and start `redis-server` to enable Celery, but I lacked the necessary system permissions (`apt-get` failed with a lock file error). This was a hard blocker for populating the database via the intended application mechanism.
   - **Solution Attempt 3 (Workaround):** To unblock myself for future debugging, I added a temporary debug endpoint (`/api/debug/deal/<asin>`) to `wsgi_handler.py`. This endpoint allowed me to query the live database and cache for a specific ASIN. While this worked for diagnosis, it highlighted that my local environment was not fully set up. *This endpoint was removed before final submission to keep the codebase clean.*
2. **Fixing Non-Data-Dependent Issues:**
   - **Problem:** While blocked on data-dependent issues, I could still address problems that were pure logic changes.
   - Solution:
     - **1yr. Avg. & %⇩:** I modified `keepa_deals/new_analytics.py`. The `get_1yr_avg_sale_price` function was updated to return the string "Too New" instead of "-" when there were insufficient sale events. The dependent `get_percent_discount` function was also updated to recognize and handle this new string gracefully.
     - **Condition Mapping:** I reviewed the Keepa API documentation and found a mapping for numeric condition codes. I updated the `api_deals` function in `wsgi_handler.py` to include a dictionary (`condition_code_map`) that translates these codes into human-readable strings (e.g., `11` -> `Collectible - Very Good`). I also added a fallback to display `Unknown ({code})` for any unmapped values.
3. **Code Review & Cleanup:**
   - **Problem:** My first code review pointed out that I had included temporary log files (`scan_status.json`, `server.log`) in my changes.
   - **Solution:** I used `restore_file` to revert `scan_status.json` and `delete_file` to remove `server.log`, ensuring a clean commit.

**Final Outcome:** The task was partially completed. The fixes for "1yr. Avg." and "Condition" were successfully implemented and submitted. The remaining issues ("Trend" and "Trust/Seller Name") require a fully functional environment with a fresh database and will be passed to the next agent.

### **Dev Log Entry:**

**Date:** 2025-10-04 **Author:** Jules **Task:** Fix Dashboard Data Display Issues (Trend, Trust, Sells, % Down)

#### **Objective:**

Resolve several data display inconsistencies on the deals dashboard.

1. The "Trend" column showed "-" for some products.
2. The "Trust" and "Seller Name" columns showed unhelpful placeholders for some offers.
3. The "Sells Period" column showed "N/A", which was uninformative.
4. The "% Down" column showed "-" for some products.

#### **Challenges & Strategy:**

The primary challenge was a highly unstable local Flask server environment, which made it impossible to use the application's debug endpoints reliably. The server would frequently fail to start with an `OSError: Address already in use`, even after attempts to kill the process.

To overcome this, the strategy was pivoted away from relying on the server. Instead, small, standalone Python debug scripts (`test_fixes.py`, `debug_seller.py`, `debug_final.py`) were created to directly call the relevant data processing functions from the `keepa_deals` module. This allowed for targeted, isolated testing of the logic without the interference of the unstable server environment.

#### **Execution and Resolution:**

**1. "Trend" Column Fix:**

- **Problem:** The column showed "-" even for products with a clear price trend.
- **Investigation:** A debug script was used to fetch raw data for a problematic ASIN (`B004YLROA0`). Analysis showed the `get_trend` function in `keepa_deals/new_analytics.py` was *only* analyzing the "NEW" price history (`csv[1]`). The ASIN in question had a rich "USED" price history (`csv[2]`) but no "NEW" history.
- **Solution:** The `get_trend` function was refactored. It now first attempts to calculate a trend from the "NEW" price data. If no trend is found, it falls back to using the "USED" price data, making the calculation more robust.

**2. "Trust" & "Seller Name" Column Fix:**

- **Problem:** Columns showed "Data Unavailable" or "-".
- **Investigation:** A debug script was used to call the Keepa API for specific seller IDs (`A1UEU9AQT0O9WX`). The investigation revealed that the Keepa API returned a successful (HTTP 200) but empty response for certain inactive seller IDs, consuming 0 tokens.
- **Solution:** The logic in `keepa_deals/seller_info.py` was updated. It now explicitly checks if the `seller_data` object returned from the API is empty. If it is, it populates the columns with more descriptive strings: "No Seller Info" and "N/A", as requested.

**3. "Sells Period", "Season", and "% Down" Columns (Multi-step Fix):**

- **Request 1:** Change "Sells Period" header to "Sells" and use more descriptive text than "N/A".
- **Solution 1:**
  - The column header was changed from "Sells Period" to "Sells" in `templates/dashboard.html`.
  - The logic in `keepa_deals/Keepa_Deals.py` was updated to check if a book's `detailed_season` is "Year-round". If so, it now writes "None" to the `Detailed_Seasonality` column and "All Year" to the `Sells` column.
  - The `get_sells_period` function in `keepa_deals/seasonality_classifier.py` was also updated for consistency.
- **Request 2:** Investigate why the `"% Down"` column still showed "-" for ASIN `0990926907`.
- **Investigation 2:**
  1. After viewing the Keepa chart for the ASIN, the hypothesis was formed that the issue stemmed from the `get_1yr_avg_sale_price` function, which requires at least three *inferred sale events* (an offer count drop followed by a sales rank drop) in the last 365 days.
  2. A debug script confirmed this hypothesis: the algorithm only found **2** inferred sale events for that ASIN in the last year, causing `get_1yr_avg_sale_price` to correctly return "Too New".
  3. A subsequent change was made to propagate this "Too New" status to the `"% Down"` column. However, the user reported the column was now blank instead of showing "Too New".
  4. Final diagnosis via `sqlite3` queries revealed the root cause: The `save_to_database` function in `Keepa_Deals.py` was creating the `Percent_Down` column with a `REAL` (numeric) data type. When the script tried to save the **text** "Too New" to this numeric column, the database rejected it, resulting in a `NULL` (blank) value.
- **Solution 2:** The `save_to_database` function was modified to add a specific exception for the `Percent_Down` column, forcing its data type to be `TEXT`. This allows it to correctly store both percentage strings and status strings like "Too New".

#### **Key Learnings:**

- When a local server environment is unstable, creating targeted, standalone debug scripts is a highly effective strategy for testing data processing logic in isolation.
- The `infer_sale_events` algorithm is strict. A long price history does not guarantee a calculable average if recent sale patterns do not meet the specific criteria (offer drop -> rank drop).
- Database schema typing is critical. A mismatch between the data being generated (e.g., a string like "Too New") and the column's data type (e.g., `REAL`) can cause silent data-saving failures. This should be a primary suspect if data appears correct during processing but is missing from the database.

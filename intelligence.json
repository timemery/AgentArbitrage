    "Core Arbitrage Philosophy: Exploit pricing inefficiencies by buying undervalued items from retail discounts, clearances, online platforms, or thrifts, and reselling via FBA for Prime eligibility, buy box advantages, and higher margins, stacking coupons, cashback, and promotions without physical sourcing or branding.",
    "Focus on Used Books and Textbooks: Prioritize abundant used books, especially textbooks and non-fiction, for low-risk entry with minimal costs, low competition in niches, pricing gaps, and straightforward arbitrage.",
    "Historical Data Analysis for Valuation: Use Keepa for long-term price trends, BSR fluctuations, offer counts, sales velocity, and EKG patterns on logarithmic scales to identify undervalued items with sustained demand and profitable flips beyond snapshots.",
    "Supply-Demand Dynamics: Monitor offer counts, sales rank, stock status, competition, and scarcity to predict price movements\u2014low supply with steady demand drives spikes; time buys during dips/stockouts and sells during peaks, avoiding high competition or Amazon dominance.",
    "Seasonal and Event-Driven Opportunities: Capitalize on cyclical spikes in textbooks, holidays, events, or media releases by sourcing low off-season, holding for surges, and using alerts for proactive identification of sudden demand increases.",
    "Risk Management via Diversification: Spread inventory across titles, categories, variations, platforms, and fulfillment methods to hedge volatility, obsolescence, or IP issues; start small (3-20 units), test performance, and maintain ROI thresholds (25-30%) as buffers.",
    "Condition and Seller Vetting: Assess book condition, seller feedback, edition viability, reviews, and descriptions to avoid returns, defects, or IP issues; prioritize functional items, underpromise ratings, and pre-purchase checks for budget buyers.",
    "FBA vs FBM Fulfillment Strategy: Use FBA for Prime premiums, scalability, high-velocity items, and passive sales (10-30% higher prices); FBM for low-cost quick flips, lightweight books, testing, or hazmat; hybrids for flexibility, treating costs as equivalent after discounts.",
    "Buy Box Positioning: Secure wins through competitive pricing, FBA eligibility, low defects, tracking, and professionalism to boost visibility (80-90% sales driver); price above FBM but below Amazon new, avoiding penny wars, dominance, and suppression.",
    "Pricing Strategy: Set dynamic min/max based on historical averages, competition, fees, velocity, and volatility for quick profitable sales (e.g., $3 min profit); use repricers, AI, psychological tactics, and adaptation to shifts, repricing wars, or overnight tests.",

**Task:** Style and Formatting Overhaul for Deals Dashboard & Subsequent Bug Fixes

**Objective:** The initial goal was to implement a series of frontend styling and data presentation changes on the Deals Dashboard. This included renaming headers, standardizing date/time formats, abbreviating text values for book conditions, and adjusting CSS styles for hover effects.

**Summary of a Multi-Stage Debugging Process:**

This task, which began as a straightforward frontend styling request, evolved into a multi-stage debugging effort that revealed several incorrect assumptions about the data pipeline. The final solution required correcting both backend and frontend logic to align with the user's requirements and the system's actual behavior.

**1. Initial Implementation and "The `NaN` Bug":**

- **The Mistake:** My first implementation incorrectly assumed that the "Changed" column needed to be created in the backend. I added a `get_changed` function to `keepa_deals/new_analytics.py` which created a new "Changed" field. This was redundant, as the data already existed in the `last price change` column.
- **The Consequence:** This new backend logic passed a Keepa-specific timestamp to the frontend's `formatTimeAgo` function. The function was not designed to parse this format, leading to an invalid date and causing the UI to display `"NaNyrs. ago"`.
- **The Correction:** Based on user feedback, I correctly identified that the change should be purely on the frontend. The first step was to remove the new, incorrect backend logic.

**2. The "Empty Column" Bug:**

- **The Mistake:** After removing the backend changes, I updated the frontend JavaScript in `templates/dashboard.html` to use the existing `last price change` column. However, I incorrectly used the key `'last price change'` (with a space) in the `columnsToShow` array and the rendering logic.
- **The Consequence:** The user correctly pointed out that the "Changed" column was now completely empty (displaying "-"). This was because the backend API, after retrieving data from the database, sends a JSON object where column names have been "sanitized." The database process had converted the column name `last price change` to `last_price_change` (with an underscore). My frontend code was trying to access a key that didn't exist in the data it received.

**3. The Final, Correct Solution:**

The final, successful implementation involved correcting the frontend code to match the actual data structure provided by the API and the user's original requirements.

- **Backend Cleanup:** The `get_changed` function was completely removed from `keepa_deals/new_analytics.py` and the corresponding call was removed from the processing loop in `keepa_deals/Keepa_Deals.py`. This ensured the backend data pipeline was left in its original, correct state.
- **Frontend Data Key Fix (`templates/dashboard.html`):** The `columnsToShow` array and the `renderTable` function were modified to use the correct data key: `last_price_change` (with an underscore).
- **Frontend Header Mapping (`templates/dashboard.html`):** The `headerTitleMap` was updated to map the `last_price_change` key to the display text "Changed".
- **Robust Date Parsing (`templates/dashboard.html`):** The `formatTimeAgo` function was significantly improved. It now contains specific logic to parse the `MM/DD/YY HH:MM` format provided by the `last_price_change` column, while still supporting the ISO 8601 format used by the `Deal_found` column.
- **Full Implementation of Original Requests:** All other initial styling and formatting requests were also successfully implemented in `templates/dashboard.html` and `static/global.css`.

**Key Takeaways for Future Agents:**

1. **Data Sanitization is Key:** Be aware that when data is pulled from the database for the API, column names with spaces (like `"last price change"`) are sanitized to use underscores (`"last_price_change"`). The frontend JavaScript **must** use the underscore version to access the data.
2. **Verify Data Formats:** Different data columns can have different formats. In this case, `Deal_found` uses the ISO 8601 standard, while `last_price_change` uses a custom `MM/DD/YY HH:MM` format. Frontend parsing functions must be robust enough to handle the specific format of the column they are processing.
3. **Distinguish Presentation from Processing:** User requests for UI changes (renaming headers, reformatting data) should, by default, be implemented purely on the frontend (in HTML/CSS/JS) unless there is a clear reason to modify the backend data pipeline. Avoid adding redundant data to the backend.

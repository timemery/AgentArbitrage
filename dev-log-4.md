DEV LOG 4

Dev Log Entry: 500 Internal Server Error Investigation. Date: 2025-09-15. Issue: User reported a persistent 500 Internal Server Error. Investigation Steps: 1. Initial Hypothesis: Configuration Error. I suspected an issue with the .env file loading in wsgi_handler.py due to a hardcoded absolute path. This was confirmed as a bug and the path was changed to be dynamic. 2. Persistent 500 Error & Log Analysis. The error continued. The user provided the app.log file. 3. Second Hypothesis: Type Error in Template. The log showed a ValueError in templates/deal_detail.html. Numeric data was being passed as a string from the database and then formatted as a float in the template, causing a crash. The fix was to cast the values to float before formatting. Resolution Attempts & System Failures: This task was plagued by catastrophic tool failures. submit, patch, read_file, reset_all, and run_in_bash_session all failed or hung repeatedly. The message_user tool also failed with complex messages. Final Outcome: The only method of delivering the fix was to provide the full source code of the two affected files as plain text for the user to manually copy and paste. Summary of Fixes: Corrected the .env loading path in wsgi_handler.py. Added float() casting to numeric formatting in templates/deal_detail.html.

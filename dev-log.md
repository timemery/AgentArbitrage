# Agent Arbitrage Development Log

## August 2025

This log provides a summary of the key development activities for the Agent Arbitrage project.

### **Week 1-2: Initial Setup and Guided Learning MVP (Early August)**

*   **Project Initialization:**
    *   Set up the Flask application structure on the Hostinger VPS.
    *   Established the initial technology stack: Python, Flask, `httpx`, `BeautifulSoup`.
    *   Configured the Apache server with WSGI to serve the Flask application.

*   **Guided Learning - Phase 1 (Scraping & Summarization):**
    *   Developed the `/guided_learning` page with a form for users to submit a URL or text.
    *   Implemented a scraping function in `app.py` to fetch and parse content from submitted URLs, stripping HTML tags to extract clean text.
    *   Integrated the Hugging Face API (`facebook/bart-large-cnn` model) to perform text summarization.

### **Week 2-3: Debugging and UX Improvements (Mid August)**

*   **Hugging Face API Authentication:**
    *   **Issue:** The application was failing to connect to the Hugging Face API, resulting in a `401 Unauthorized` error on the VPS.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Discovered that the `.env` file containing the `HF_TOKEN` was not loading correctly in the Apache/mod_wsgi environment.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `app.py` to use `load_dotenv('/var/www/agentarbitrage/.env')`, providing an explicit path to the `.env` file. Added logging to confirm the token was loaded successfully.

*   **Improving User Experience (UX):**
    *   **Issue:** The scraping and summarization process could take a significant amount of time, making the application feel unresponsive.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Added a progress spinner and a "Processing..." message to the `/guided_learning` page. The spinner appears after the user clicks "Submit for Analysis."
        *   Disabled the "Submit" and "Clear Session" buttons during processing to prevent multiple submissions.
        *   Improved the visual distinction between the "Submit" (blue) and "Clear Session" (red) buttons.

*   **Routing and Code Cleanup:**
    *   **Issue:** Redundant routing and authentication. The `/app` route was protected by Apache's Basic Authentication, creating a confusing double login.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Removed the `/app` route from `app.py` and the corresponding `<Location /app>` block from the Apache configuration.
        *   The root URL (`/`) now serves the login page (`index.html`), which submits to `/login` and redirects to `/guided_learning` on success.
        *   Updated `index.html` and `results.html` to use `url_for('guided_learning')` instead of the old `/app` route.

*   **Performance and Stability:**
    *   **Issue:** Summarization of very long texts was slow and sometimes failed.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Implemented a chunking mechanism in `app.py` to split long texts into smaller pieces (512 words) before sending them to the Hugging Face API.
        *   Limited the input text for summarization to 50,000 characters to prevent excessive processing times.
    *   **Issue:** Sensitive information (like `.env` files) could be accidentally committed.
    *   **Resolution:** Verified that the `.gitignore` file correctly excludes `.env`, `app.log`, and other sensitive files.

*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Issue:** Data persisted between sessions, causing confusion.
    *   **Resolution:** Improved the `/clear_session` route to properly clear all relevant data from the session and delete temporary files, providing a "Session cleared!" message to the user.

### **Next Steps (Week 2-3 Continued)**

*   **Extract Key Strategies:** Implement functionality to extract specific, actionable strategies and parameters (e.g., "sales rank between X and Y") from the summarized text.
*   **Approval Interface:** Display these extracted strategies on the `/results` page for user review, editing, and approval.



**Date: August 9, 2025**

- **Task:** Debug and resolve strategy extraction failure.
- **Issue:** The initial implementation using `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` failed to extract strategies, returning an error.
- Troubleshooting:
  1. Enhanced error reporting in `app.py` to get detailed API responses.
  2. Added a retry mechanism to handle potential `503` errors caused by model loading times.
  3. The detailed error was a `404 Not Found`, indicating the Mistral model is not available on the standard Inference API.
  4. Upgraded to a Hugging Face Pro subscription to improve overall API stability and performance.
- **Resolution:** Decided to switch the strategy extraction model to `google/flan-t5-large`, which is a powerful and reliably available model for this task.

**Date: August 9, 2025**
- I have changed the strategy extraction model to t5-small in app.py.

**Date: August 12-15, 2025**

- **Task:** Debug persistent 404 errors for strategy extraction models and enhance strategy output.
- **Issue:** POST requests to `google/flan-t5-large`, `t5-small`, `bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-uncased`, and `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` returned 404 ("Not Found", "X-Cache: Error from cloudfront") despite Pro account and correct headers/payloads.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1. Tested models with curl (`facebook/bart-large-cnn` worked; others failed).
  2. Posted to Hugging Face General forum[](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/general/10) and Discord #help, confirming non-`facebook/` models are not deployed on Inference API.
  3. Disabled leaked API key [REDACTED_HF_TOKEN_1] and generated new one [REDACTED_HF_TOKEN_1].
  4. Tested `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` (404, not deployed despite listing).
- **Resolution:** Reverted to `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for scraping and summarization. Optimized `app.py` prompt for actionable rules (e.g., sales rank, profit margin). Plan to test xAI API (free credit) for strategy extraction due to its reasoning capabilities.
- **Proposed Fix:** Update `app.py` to use `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for summarization, add xAI API fallback for strategy extraction, and refine regex for precise rules. Test 100-200 articles with xAI to align with project goal of failproof arbitrage.

# Agent Arbitrage Development Log

## August 2025
- **Aug 2, 2025**: Fixed "Forbidden" error on `https://agentarbitrage.co` by resolving duplicate WSGI daemon in `agentarbitrage-le-ssl.conf`. Updated `app.py`, `index.html`, `guided_learning.html` to handle main page and login (`tester`/`OnceUponaBurgerTree-12monkeys`). Moved `AIGIRL.jpg` to `static` and fixed path in `index.html`.
- **Aug 2, 2025**: Encountered "Hello World" issue after `git reset --hard origin/main` reverted to outdated commit (`93720e9`). Restored `app.py`, `guided_learning.html`, and `index.html` from backup. Forced Git push to sync all files to `https://github.com/timemery/AgentArbitrage`.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Added Hugging Face API key setup for Julesâ€™ Guided Learning module (Weeks 2-3: URL scraping, summarization). Documented VPS change commands in `README.md`.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Confirmed commands to apply changes: `touch wsgi.py` for Python changes, Apache restart for templates/static files, and config copying for Apache config updates.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Identified an issue with the summarization of long texts. The current model fails on long inputs.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Planned next steps for the Guided Learning module:
  - Implement chunking to handle long texts without truncation.
  - Add support for YouTube transcripts.
  - Explore other summarization models for different types of content.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Implemented the initial version of the Guided Learning module.
  - Added URL scraping functionality to extract text from web pages.
  - Integrated the Hugging Face API for text summarization.
  - Created a results page to display the scraped text and the AI-generated summary.
  - Added a rule review interface to allow users to edit and approve the generated rules.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Identified an issue with the summarization of long texts. The current model fails on long inputs.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Implemented a chunking mechanism to handle long texts without truncation.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Discovered that the summarization is still failing, even with the chunking mechanism. The summary is not being displayed on the results page.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Added debugging statements to `app.py` to investigate the summarization issue. The new code will print information about the summarization process to the Apache error log.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Increased the timeout limit in the Apache configuration to prevent the summarization request from timing out.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Fixed an issue with duplicate WSGI daemon definitions in the Apache configuration.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Fixed an issue with the session not being cleared between requests.
- **Aug 3, 2025**: Identified a new issue with scraping certain websites, resulting in a "403 Client Error: Forbidden" error. This is likely due to websites blocking requests from automated scripts.

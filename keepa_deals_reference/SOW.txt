Agent Arbitrage
Scope of Work

Project Overview

Title: Agent Arbitrage (Working Title)
Start Date: March 29, 2025
Prepared By: Tim, with assistance from Grok 3 (xAI) and Jules.
Version: 1.1 (Draft) - July 16, 2025 (Jules: Added Future Considerations section)

This Scope of Work outlines the development of "Agent Arbitrage," a multi-phase project aimed at leveraging the Keepa API and advanced AI to streamline online book arbitrage. The initial phase focuses on extracting comprehensive data from Keepa’s Deals page to identify profitable used books. Subsequent phases will introduce a semi-autonomous AI agent capable of learning profitability patterns, simulating book purchases in a demo mode, and eventually executing real transactions and Amazon listing updates on behalf of subscribed users. The ultimate goal is a hands-off, subscription-based service that maximizes profits for Amazon sellers. (It's better than this sounds… a big part of online arbitrage is knowing how to assess books, and learning how to navigate Amazon itself, as well as tracking sales, purchases, returns… dealing with a prep service… so much more…)

Project Objectives

Phase 1: Data Extraction via Keepa API
Objective:
Develop a robust system to pull and process data from Keepa’s `/deals` and `/product` endpoints, targeting used books with 50%+ price drops, and output a 229-column tab-delimited CSV (`keepa_full_deals.csv`).
Scope:
Extract 900–1,000+ ASINs daily from Keepa’s Deals page (Boxes 1: Used books, 50%+ off).
Collect all 229 data points per ASIN as defined in the (Keepa Data Types Google doc - link it here) doc including the full list of data types in order, with api endpoints and notes on each.
Output a tab-delimited CSV matching the 229-column specification for integration with Google Sheets or other tools.
Deliverables:
Python script (`Process500_Deals_v2.py` - now `Keepa_Deals.py`) fetching and processing data.
CSV file (`keepa_full_deals.csv` - now `Keepa_Deals_Export.csv`) with 900–1,000+ rows and 229 columns (currently 216, to be expanded).
Development log tracking progress and issues.

Phase 2: Demo Mode Simulation
Objective:
Build a demo mode to simulate buying and selling books without real transactions, tracking hypothetical profits using Keepa price data.
Scope:
Simulate "purchasing" books at current Keepa prices (e.g., Used Buy Box price).
Monitor price trends over time (real-time or historical backtesting) to determine if a target sell price is reached.
Estimate sales volume using sales rank trends or historical data.
Calculate profits: `(sell_price - buy_price) × units_sold - (FBA Pick&Pack Fee + Referral Fee % × sell_price)`.
Log results for analysis (e.g., “Bought ASIN B08XYZ1234 at $10, sold at $15, profit: $12”).
Deliverables:
  - Enhanced Python script integrating demo mode with Keepa API data.
  - Demo log or dashboard showing simulated trade outcomes.
  - Validation of profitability metrics using historical data.

Phase 3: Web Application Development
Objective:
Transform the demo mode into a subscriber-accessible web application for testing and interaction.
Scope:
Develop a Flask-based web app with:
User authentication (login/signup).
Subscription management (e.g., Stripe integration for monthly fees).
Demo interface: Input ASINs, set buy/sell prices, view simulated trade results.
Host on a scalable platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Ensure security: Password hashing, HTTPS, API key protection.
Deliverables:
Deployed web application accessible via URL.
User guide for subscribers.
Backend database (e.g., SQLite) storing user data and trade simulations.

Phase 4: Semi-Autonomous AI Agent
Objective:
Create a semi-autonomous AI agent that learns profitability patterns and executes tasks with minimal user intervention.
Scope:
Learning Capability:
Train the agent using Keepa data and external sources (e.g., video tutorial transcripts like “How to Use Keepa to Find Products to Sell on Amazon”).
Implement rule-based logic (e.g., “buy if price < 80% of 90-day avg”) and machine learning (e.g., reinforcement learning to optimize profit).
Task Automation:
Interface with Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API) to:
Purchase books based on learned criteria.
Update listings (e.g., adjust prices based on sales rank trends).
Monitor Keepa API for real-time price updates.
User Integration:
Allow subscribers to input Amazon Seller account credentials securely (via OAuth or encrypted storage).
Execute trades and listings on users’ behalf, with approval workflows for safety.
Deliverables:
AI agent script integrating Keepa API, Amazon SP-API, and learning models.
Training dataset derived from Keepa data and tutorial content.
Subscriber dashboard with trade approvals and performance metrics.

Phase 5: Full Autonomy and Scaling
Objective:
Achieve near-full autonomy, enabling hands-off arbitrage for subscribers.
Scope:
Refine learning to adapt to market trends without manual rule updates.
Expand to multiple product categories beyond books if viable.
Optimize for scale: Handle thousands of ASINs and multiple user accounts.
Add notifications (e.g., email alerts for trade completions or errors).
Deliverables:
Fully autonomous agent deployed within the web app.
Scalability report detailing performance under load.
User feedback system to refine agent behavior.

Project Scope Details

Data Points
Total Fields: Aiming for 229, as specified in the "Keepa API Data Types" Google Doc. Currently implementing 216.
Key Additions (to reach 229):
`Package Weight`, `Package Height`, `Package Length`, `Package Width` (positions 35–38).
Purpose: Enable calculation of `FBA Pick&Pack Fee` and `Referral Fee %` using Amazon’s fee formulas and category-specific rates.
Source: Primarily Keepa `/product` endpoint, supplemented by `/deals` for pre-filtered ASINs.

Technical Requirements
Environment: Python 3.10.17 in a virtual environment (e.g., `~/keepa_api/keepa-deals/venv`).
Dependencies:
`requests`, `retrying`, `pandas`, `pytz` (current).
Future: Flask (web app), Stripe (subscriptions), Amazon SP-API (listing updates), potentially `aiohttp` (for async API calls).
Optional: TensorFlow/PyTorch (learning), Selenium (if browser automation needed).
APIs:
Keepa API (token replenishment rate to be respected, e.g., ~300 tokens per hour).
Amazon SP-API (OAuth authentication for Seller accounts).
YouTube Data API (for tutorial transcripts, if pursued).

---
SOW Tie-In for Fee Calculations (Existing Note)
Phase 1 Fit: These calcs slot into your 229-column CSV:
FBA Pick & Pack Fee (Row 15): Populate with calc_fba_fee() using packageWeight, packageHeight, etc. Add is_apparel flag (manual or infer from productGroup/categories).
Referral Fee % (Row 16): Populate with calc_referral_fee() using a placeholder sell_price (e.g., stats.current[2] or 90-day avg) and category from productGroup or categories[0].
Output: keepa_full_deals.csv gets two new columns with estimated fees—done!
Future Phases:
Phase 2: Refine with simulated sell_price from demo trades, test against historical profitability.
Phase 4: Swap for SP-API (GetFulfillmentPreview, GetItemEligibilityPreview) when the agent goes live—100% accuracy.
---

Success Criteria
Phase 1: CSV with 700–1,000+ ASINs and all target columns (initially 216, aiming for 229) populated, validated against Keepa Deals page data. Script runs to completion without crashing due to API limits.
Phase 2: Demo mode accurately simulates trades with profit estimates matching manual calculations.
Phase 3: Web app supports 10+ concurrent users, processes demo requests in <5 seconds.
Phase 4: AI agent executes 90% of trades correctly in demo mode, learns at least 5 profitability rules.
Phase 5: Fully autonomous system achieves 80%+ profitable trades over 30 days for 5+ subscribers.

---

Timeline (Estimated)

Phase 1: Ongoing (Data extraction, CSV output, API limit handling).
Phase 2: 1 week (Post Phase 1 completion) - Demo mode development.
Phase 3: 2–3 weeks - Web app with subscriptions.
Phase 4: 3–4 weeks - Semi-autonomous agent with learning.
Phase 5: 4–6 weeks - Full autonomy and scaling.
Total: ~13–18 weeks (assuming iterative development and testing).

Future Considerations / Potential Phase X: Web Application with Real-Time Updates

Objective:
To refactor the script into a web server application that produces results in HTML within a browser, potentially incorporating a mechanism to listen for (or more accurately, detect through polling) changes to Keepa data and update the displayed results dynamically.

Conceptual Framework:

1.  Backend System (e.g., Python with Flask/Django):
    *   Persistent Data Storage: Utilize a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store fetched Keepa product information, replacing direct CSV output for the web view.
    *   Scheduled Data Polling: Implement a robust backend process (e.g., using Celery, APScheduler, or cron jobs) to periodically query the Keepa API for updated information on tracked ASINs. This process would incorporate the existing rate-limiting and token management logic.
    *   Change Detection: Upon fetching new data from Keepa, the backend would compare it against the currently stored data in the database to identify significant changes (e.g., price updates, sales rank shifts, offer count changes).
    *   API Endpoints: Develop API endpoints for the frontend to fetch initial data and potentially to subscribe to or poll for updates.

2.  Frontend System (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
    *   Initial Data Rendering: On page load, JavaScript will fetch the current dataset from a backend API endpoint and render it as HTML.
    *   Dynamic Update Mechanisms:
        *   WebSockets: For efficient, low-latency, bidirectional communication. The backend could push detected changes to connected clients.
        *   Server-Sent Events (SSE): A simpler, unidirectional (server-to-client) mechanism for pushing updates.
        *   Long Polling / Short Polling: As fallback or simpler alternatives, where the client periodically asks the server for updates.
    *   DOM Manipulation: JavaScript will update the HTML content dynamically when new data or change notifications are received from the backend.

3.  Keepa API Interaction Model:
    *   It's important to note that the Keepa API is request-response based and does not offer direct push notifications (webhooks) for data changes.
    *   Therefore, the "listening" aspect involves the project's backend server regularly polling the Keepa API. The real-time updates to the user's browser are then driven by changes detected by this backend polling mechanism.
    *   The frequency of polling the Keepa API by the backend must be carefully managed to respect API token limits and replenishment rates.

This enhancement would transform the current script into a more interactive and potentially real-time dashboard for users, but it relies on the backend's ability to efficiently poll Keepa and manage updates.

---

Next Steps

Immediate: Continue testing and refining Phase 1 (robust data extraction for all ASINs with dynamic rate limiting). Gather feedback on the performance of the current throttling mechanism.
Short-Term: Based on Phase 1 stability and performance, begin planning for Phase 2 (Demo Mode Simulation).
Long-Term: Evaluate the feasibility and user demand for a web application interface (as per "Future Considerations") after core data extraction and simulation functionalities are solidified.

Agent Arbitrage
(working title)
Project Objectives - SOW:

To pull data from Keepa’s API based on parameters set on user settings from the Keepa Deals page. This data will also include a vast array of data points including the following: Percent down, Avg. Price, Price Now, Deal found, AMZ link, Keepa Link, Title, last update, last price change, Sales Rank - Reference, Reviews - Rating, Reviews - Review Count, FBA Pick&Pack Fee, Referral Fee %, Tracking since, Categories - Root, Categories - Sub, Categories - Tree, ASIN, Freq. Bought Together, Type, Manufacturer, Brand, Product Group, Variation Attributes, Item Type, Author, Contributors, Binding, Number of Items, Number of Pages, Publication Date, Languages, Package - Quantity, Package Weight, Package Height, Package Length, Package Width, Listed since, Edition, Release Date, Format, Sales Rank - Current, Sales Rank - 30 days avg., 229 data points in all as they apply to between 900 to 1000+ ASINs that exist on the Keepa Deals page. This is only the first phase of this project. Once we’re able to capture all data points we need via the Keepa API, we will begin investigating the development of a semi autonomous AI agent that is capable first of learning what data is needed in order to predict what books would be profitable in an online arbitrage situation, where the user would subscribe to this agent, input account details for their amazon sellers account and all other information required to allow the agent to purchase and list books on the users behalf in a nearly entirely hands-off way.

Another question. Do you have the knowledge it would take to build a fully autonomous AI agent that could perform tasks, and learning as well as interface with other applications including buying products online, and accessing my amazon account to update listings etc... Those are just some examples of what I'd like it to do, but the question is, are you capable of assisting in building that autonomous AI agent?

This is a fascinating question! Yes, I have the knowledge to assist you in building a fully autonomous AI agent capable of performing tasks, learning, and interfacing with applications—including buying products online, updating Amazon listings, and more. However, there are some practical and ethical boundaries to consider, and my role would be to guide you through the design, development, and implementation process rather than executing real-world actions (like making purchases) myself. Let’s break this down to see what’s possible and how I could help.
What an Autonomous AI Agent Entails
An autonomous AI agent would need:
Task Execution: Ability to perform predefined tasks (e.g., scraping data, buying products, updating listings).
Learning: Adapt and improve over time (e.g., via reinforcement learning or supervised feedback).
Application Interfaces: Interact with external systems (e.g., Amazon Seller Central, web browsers, APIs).
Decision-Making: Make choices autonomously based on goals (e.g., "buy this if price < $X").
Safety & Ethics: Operate within legal and account-specific constraints (e.g., Amazon’s terms of service).
My Capabilities
As Grok 3 from xAI, I can:
Design the Architecture: Propose a system combining Python (for scripting), APIs (for Amazon, Keepa, etc.), and machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for learning.
Write Code: Provide detailed scripts for web scraping, API calls, browser automation (e.g., Selenium), and task workflows—like we’ve done with the Keepa scraper.
Integrate Tools: Guide you on interfacing with Amazon Seller Central (via Amazon SP-API), e-commerce sites, or other platforms using APIs or browser automation.
Implement Learning: Suggest and code learning mechanisms (e.g., a model to optimize listing prices based on historical sales data).
Debug & Optimize: Help troubleshoot crashes, refine logic, and ensure robustness (e.g., handling OTPs or rate limits).
Explain Concepts: Break down complex topics (e.g., OAuth for Amazon authentication, NLP for parsing product descriptions) so you can build and tweak it.
Example Features I Could Help With
Buying Products Online:
Use Selenium to automate browser interactions or APIs (e.g., Amazon’s Product Advertising API) to monitor prices and place orders.
Code a decision rule: "If price drops 20% and stock > 5, buy 2 units."
I’d provide the script; you’d run it with your credentials.
Updating Amazon Listings:
Leverage Amazon’s SP-API (Selling Partner API) to pull listings, modify prices/descriptions, and push updates.
Example: "Increase price by 10% if sales rank < 10,000."
I’d guide you through API setup (OAuth, endpoints) and code the requests.
Learning:
Build a reinforcement learning agent to optimize buying/selling (e.g., maximize profit based on Keepa data).
Use historical data (e.g., from our scraper) to train it—e.g., "Learn which price drops predict stockouts."
Interfacing:
Connect to Keepa API for price tracking, Amazon SP-API for account actions, or even email clients for notifications.
Example: "Email me when a listing update fails."
How I’d Assist
Step-by-Step Plan: Outline phases (e.g., API setup, task scripting, learning integration).
Code Snippets: Provide full scripts—like the Keepa scraper but expanded for Amazon logins, purchases, etc.
Tool Recommendations: Suggest libraries (e.g., requests for APIs, selenium for web, scikit-learn for learning).
Security Tips: Advise on storing credentials (e.g., environment variables), avoiding bans, and complying with terms of service.
Iteration: Refine based on your feedback—like we’re doing now with v11.
Limitations
Execution: I can’t run the agent myself (e.g., log into your Amazon account or spend money)—you’d deploy it on your machine or a server.
Real-Time Access: I can’t directly interface with your live Amazon account; I’d code the logic, and you’d supply credentials/data.
Ethics & Legality: I’d ensure the design respects platform rules (e.g., no scraping where prohibited, no account sharing violations). For Amazon updates, we’d stick to SP-API, not hacky workarounds.
Complexity: Full autonomy with learning is resource-intensive—think weeks of dev time, not days, depending on scope.
Sample Architecture
Here’s a quick sketch of what I could help you build:
import os
from amazon_sp_api import ListingsItems  # Hypothetical SP-API wrapper
from selenium import webdriver
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression  # For learning
import keepa

class AutonomousAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Browser automation
        self.amazon_api = ListingsItems(credentials=os.getenv("AMAZON_CREDS"))
        self.keepa_api = keepa.Keepa(os.getenv("KEEPA_KEY"))
        self.model = LogisticRegression()  # Simple learning model

    def monitor_prices(self, asins):
        data = self.keepa_api.query(asins)
        return {asin: data[asin]["price"] for asin in asins}

    def buy_product(self, url, threshold):
        self.driver.get(url)
        price = float(self.driver.find_element_by_id("price").text[1:])
        if price < threshold:
            self.driver.find_element_by_id("buy-now").click()
            print(f"Bought at ${price}")

    def update_listing(self, asin, new_price):
        self.amazon_api.put_listing(asin, price=new_price)
        print(f"Updated {asin} to ${new_price}")

    def learn_optimal_price(self, historical_data):
        X = historical_data["prices"]
        y = historical_data["sales"]
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        return self.model.predict([X[-1]])  # Predict next best price

    def run(self):
        asins = ["B08XYZ1234"] * 1000
        prices = self.monitor_prices(asins)
        for asin, price in prices.items():
            if price < 50:
                self.buy_product(f"https://amazon.com/dp/{asin}", 50)
            optimal_price = self.learn_optimal_price(historical_data[asin])
            self.update_listing(asin, optimal_price)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = AutonomousAgent()
    agent.run()

This is a stub—I’d flesh it out with error handling, API calls, and real learning logic if you greenlight it.
Am I Capable?
Yes, I can absolutely assist you in building this! I’ve got the technical chops to:
Code the agent’s core (scraping, API calls, automation).
Integrate learning (e.g., predict profitable buys).
Guide you through setup (e.g., Amazon SP-API keys, Keepa tokens).
Keep it practical and legal.
Next Steps
If you want to pursue this:
Scope It: Pick 2-3 tasks (e.g., "buy products under $X," "update listings based on Keepa trends").
Tools: Confirm your Amazon Seller account and API access—I’d walk you through SP-API setup.
Timeline: Expect a basic agent in 1-2 weeks of collaboration, learning features in 3-4 weeks.
What do you think—want to start small (e.g., automate listing updates) and build from there? I’m game to dive in whenever you are!
That's great news! Can this AI agent learn from online video tutorials like this one: How to Find Amazing Books to Resell on Amazon with BookMine!

I’m glad you’re excited about the possibilities! The question of whether an AI agent can learn from online video tutorials like the one you linked (a YouTube video, “How to Use Keepa to Find Products to Sell on Amazon”) is a nuanced one. Let’s break it down and explore how I could help make this happen within the context of building your autonomous AI agent.
Can an AI Agent Learn from Video Tutorials?
In its current form, an AI like me (Grok 3) or a custom-built agent can’t directly watch and learn from a video in the human sense—processing audio, visuals, and context spontaneously. Videos are unstructured data (audio narration, on-screen text, visual demos), and extracting actionable knowledge requires specialized techniques. However, with the right tools and design, we can absolutely enable an agent to indirectly learn from video content like that Keepa tutorial. Here’s how:
Direct Limitations
No Native Video Processing: I can’t watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOZT0ybVLjQ myself—I lack real-time access to YouTube’s content and the sensory ability to interpret video frames or audio.
Agent Constraints: A basic autonomous agent (like the sample I sketched) wouldn’t have built-in video comprehension either—it’s typically coded for structured inputs (e.g., APIs, CSV data).
Workable Solutions
We can bridge this gap by converting the video’s content into a format the AI can process, then training it on that data. Here are two approaches I could assist with:
Manual Transcription + Processing:
Step 1: You (or a tool) transcribe the video into text—e.g., the narrator’s explanation of Keepa charts, price trends, and sourcing tips.
Step 2: I help you extract key insights (e.g., “If Buy Box price drops 20% below 90-day average, it’s a buy signal”) and turn them into rules or training data.
Step 3: We code these rules into the agent (e.g., if price < 0.8 * avg_90_day_price: buy()), or use the text to train a natural language model to interpret similar instructions.
Automated Video-to-Text Pipeline:
Tools: Use YouTube’s auto-captions (via API) or a speech-to-text service (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper by OpenAI) to transcribe the video.
Processing: I’d guide you to build a script that pulls the transcript, cleans it, and feeds it to an NLP (natural language processing) model (e.g., BERT, spaCy).
Learning: The agent could:
Extract rules (e.g., regex or NLP to spot “look for X” phrases).
Train on examples (e.g., “price drop → buy” patterns) to generalize to new tutorials.
How I’d Help Build This
I can’t watch the video myself, but I can assist you in creating an agent that learns from it once the content is accessible. Here’s a practical plan:
Sample Workflow
Get the Content:
Use a YouTube API (e.g., Google’s YouTube Data API) to fetch the auto-generated transcript of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOZT0ybVLjQ.
Example output: “Welcome to using Keepa… look at the Buy Box price… if it’s below the 90-day average, that’s a good deal…”
Process It:
I’d provide a Python script to parse the transcript
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi
import re

video_id = "jOZT0ybVLjQ"
transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)
text = " ".join([entry["text"] for entry in transcript])
print(text)  # "Welcome to using Keepa..."

# Extract rules
rules = []
if "below the 90-day average" in text:
    rules.append("price < avg_90_day_price * 0.8 → buy")
print(rules)

Integrate into the Agent:
Hardcode extracted rules:
def check_buy_signal(self, asin_data):
    price = asin_data["price"]
    avg_90_day = asin_data["stats"]["avg90"]
    if price < avg_90_day * 0.8:
        return True
    return False

Or train an NLP model (e.g., fine-tune a pre-trained model like DistilBERT) on the transcript to detect buy/sell logic dynamically.
Learning Over Time:
Rule-Based: Start with static rules from the video, then let the agent refine them via feedback (e.g., “Did this buy make profit?”).
Machine Learning: Use reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning) where the agent tests strategies from the video and optimizes based on outcomes (e.g., profit).
Full Agent Example
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi
import keepa

class LearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, keepa_key):
        self.keepa_api = keepa.Keepa(keepa_key)
        self.rules = []

    def learn_from_video(self, video_id):
        transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)
        text = " ".join([entry["text"] for entry in transcript])
        if "below the 90-day average" in text:
            self.rules.append(lambda data: data["price"] < data["stats"]["avg90"] * 0.8)
        print(f"Learned {len(self.rules)} rules from video {video_id}")

    def apply_rules(self, asin):
        data = self.keepa_api.query(asin)[0]
        for rule in self.rules:
            if rule(data):
                print(f"Buy signal for {asin}!")
                return True
        return False

    def run(self, asins):
        self.learn_from_video("jOZT0ybVLjQ")
        for asin in asins:
            if self.apply_rules(asin):
                self.buy_product(asin)  # Placeholder for buy logic

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = LearningAgent(os.getenv("KEEPA_KEY"))
    agent.run(["B08XYZ1234"])

My Role
Code: I’d write and refine scripts like the above—fetching transcripts, parsing rules, integrating with Keepa/Amazon.
Tools: Recommend APIs (YouTube, speech-to-text) and libraries (e.g., youtube_transcript_api, transformers for NLP).
Learning: Design how the agent adapts—static rules first, then ML if you want it to generalize across videos.
Support: Troubleshoot issues (e.g., missing captions, API limits).
Feasibility
Short-Term: Yes, I can help you build an agent that learns fixed rules from one video’s transcript (e.g., “buy if price < 80% of 90-day avg”) in a few days of work.
Long-Term: For full autonomy (watching multiple videos, extracting strategies without manual prep), we’d need advanced NLP/vision (e.g., CLIP for visuals), which is doable but takes weeks and more compute resources.
Answer
Yes, I can help you build an AI agent that learns from video tutorials like that Keepa one! It’d start by processing transcripts (manually or via API), extracting rules, and applying them to tasks. With more effort, we could add dynamic learning from multiple videos. Want to try it with this video as a proof-of-concept—say, extract one sourcing rule and test it with Keepa data?
Can the first phase of this application run in "demo" mode so that we can test everything, but not actually buy anything? Watch the sale price of a book that we pretended to buy, and see if it hits the sell price and there's enough sales that this would have made a profit if we had actually bought the book? Can you also make this into a web application that is accessible by users who subscribe to the service?

Great questions! Yes, we can absolutely design the first phase of this AI agent to run in a "demo" mode for testing—simulating buying and selling without real transactions—and track hypothetical profits based on price movements and sales data. Plus, we can turn it into a web application for subscribers. I’ll outline how I’d help you build this, keeping it practical and aligned with your goals.
Phase 1: Demo Mode with Simulated Trading
In demo mode, the agent will:
Monitor prices (e.g., via Keepa API) without making actual purchases.
"Pretend" to buy a book at a given price, track its sale price over time, and estimate profit based on a target sell price and sales volume.
Log results to evaluate performance—all without spending a dime.
How It Works
Simulated Buy:
Pick an ASIN (e.g., a book) and record the "buy price" at a specific timestamp using Keepa data.
No real Amazon purchase—just a logged entry.
Price Tracking:
Use Keepa API to monitor the Buy Box price (or another metric) daily or hourly.
Check if it hits your "sell price" threshold (e.g., buy at $10, sell at $15).
Sales Volume Check:
Estimate sales frequency using Keepa’s sales rank or historical data (e.g., “sold 5 times in 30 days”).
Assume a sale occurs when the price hits your target.
Profit Calculation:
Compute hypothetical profit: (sell_price - buy_price) × units_sold - fees.
Use Amazon’s FBA fee calculator (via API or static rates) for realism.
Demo Output:
Log: “Bought ASIN B08XYZ1234 at $10 on 2025-03-29. Sold at $15 on 2025-04-05. Est. sales: 3. Profit: $12 after fees.”
Sample Code
Here’s a basic Python script I’d help you build for demo mode:
import keepa
import time
from datetime import datetime

class DemoAgent:
    def __init__(self, keepa_key):
        self.api = keepa.Keepa(keepa_key)
        self.trades = []  # Simulated trades: {asin, buy_price, buy_date, sell_price, sell_date, profit}

    def simulate_buy(self, asin, buy_price):
        trade = {
            "asin": asin,
            "buy_price": buy_price,
            "buy_date": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "sell_price": None,
            "sell_date": None,
            "profit": None
        }
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Demo: Bought {asin} at ${buy_price}")

    def track_and_sell(self, asin, sell_target, days_to_monitor=30):
        trade = next(t for t in self.trades if t["asin"] == asin and t["sell_price"] is None)
        if not trade:
            return

        # Simulate monitoring over time (in real-time or accelerated with historical data)
        for day in range(days_to_monitor):
            data = self.api.query(asin)[0]
            current_price = data["price"]  # Buy Box price
            print(f"Day {day}: {asin} price = ${current_price}")

            if current_price >= sell_target:
                trade["sell_price"] = current_price
                trade["sell_date"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
                sales_estimate = 3  # Placeholder; could use sales rank trends
                fees = (current_price * 0.15) + 1  # Rough FBA fee (15% + $1)
                trade["profit"] = (current_price - trade["buy_price"]) * sales_estimate - fees
                print(f"Demo: Sold {asin} at ${current_price}. Est. profit: ${trade['profit']:.2f}")
                break
            time.sleep(1)  # Simulate daily check (sped up here)

    def run_demo(self, asin, buy_price, sell_target):
        self.simulate_buy(asin, buy_price)
        self.track_and_sell(asin, sell_target)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = DemoAgent(os.getenv("KEEPA_KEY"))
    agent.run_demo("B08XYZ1234", buy_price=10.0, sell_target=15.0)

Notes: This uses real-time Keepa data but fakes the timeline (sped up with sleep(1)). For true backtesting, we’d pull historical data and simulate over past months.
Turning It into a Web Application
Making this a subscriber-accessible web app is totally doable! I’d guide you to build it with a Python backend (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) and a simple frontend (e.g., HTML/CSS or a framework like React). Here’s how:
Architecture
Backend:
Framework: Flask (lightweight, beginner-friendly).
Features:
User authentication (login/signup with subscription check).
API endpoints (e.g., /demo/start, /demo/results).
Runs the DemoAgent logic, stores results in a database (e.g., SQLite).
Security: Password hashing, session management, API key protection.
Frontend:
Basic: HTML pages served by Flask with Jinja2 templates.
Fancy: React SPA (single-page app) calling backend APIs.
UI: Input ASIN, buy/sell prices, see live demo results (e.g., “Profit: $12”).
Deployment:
Host on a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
Add subscription logic (e.g., Stripe for payments).
Sample Web App Code
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, session
import os
from demo_agent import DemoAgent  # Import the class above

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.urandom(24)  # For session security
agent = DemoAgent(os.getenv("KEEPA_KEY"))

# Mock user database (replace with real DB)
users = {"user1": {"password": "pass123", "subscribed": True}}

@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.form["username"]
        password = request.form["password"]
        if username in users and users[username]["password"] == password:
            session["user"] = username
            return redirect("/demo")
        return "Login failed"
    return render_template("login.html")

@app.route("/demo", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def demo():
    if "user" not in session or not users[session["user"]]["subscribed"]:
        return redirect("/login")

    if request.method == "POST":
        asin = request.form["asin"]
        buy_price = float(request.form["buy_price"])
        sell_target = float(request.form["sell_target"])
        agent.run_demo(asin, buy_price, sell_target)
        return render_template("results.html", trades=agent.trades)
    return render_template("demo.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Templates (login.html, demo.html, results.html): Simple forms and tables—I’d provide these too.
Access: Subscribers log in, enter ASIN/buy/sell prices, and see demo results.
Subscription Model
Backend: Add a subscribed flag in a user database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
Payment: Integrate Stripe—charge $X/month, update user status on payment.
Code: I’d help you add stripe-python and a /subscribe endpoint.
My Role in Building This
Demo Mode: I’d refine the DemoAgent—add historical backtesting, fee calculations, and sales estimates using Keepa data.
Web App: Write Flask code, design templates, and guide you through deployment (e.g., Heroku setup).
Security: Ensure user data is safe (e.g., bcrypt for passwords, HTTPS).
Testing: Help you simulate trades (e.g., pick 10 ASINs, run a week-long demo) and debug.
Feasibility
Demo Mode: Easy—1-2 days to code and test with Keepa API. Backtesting with historical data might take a week for accuracy.
Web App: Basic Flask version in 3-5 days; adding subscriptions (Stripe) and polish (React) could take 1-2 weeks.
Profit Tracking: Works with Keepa’s price history and sales rank trends—realistic enough for demo purposes.
Next Steps
If you’re in:
Demo Mode: Start with a single-book demo—pick an ASIN, set buy/sell prices, and I’ll code the simulation.
Web App: Build a Flask prototype—login + demo page—then expand to subscriptions.
Test: Run it locally, watch a fake trade, and check profit logs.
Want to kick off with a demo for one book (e.g., “Buy at $10, sell at $15, track for 7 days”)? I’ll whip up the code, and we can grow it into a web app from there!

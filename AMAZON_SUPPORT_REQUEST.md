### **Support Request to Send to Amazon**

**Subject:** Unable to Access Developer Central for Private App - Incorrectly Redirected to Solution Provider Portal

**Body:**

Hello Amazon Seller Support Team,

I am trying to create a **private, self-authorized Selling Partner API (SP-API) application** for my own seller account. My goal is to integrate an application for my own business use only.

However, I am blocked. When I navigate to **Apps & Services > Develop Apps** in Seller Central, I am immediately and incorrectly redirected to the onboarding page for the Solution Provider Portal (`https://solutionproviderportal.amazon.com/...`).

I believe my developer profile has been incorrectly categorized.

Based on your official documentation, during developer registration, I should have the ability to select the option:
> "**My organization sells on Amazon, and I only want to integrate to manage my own business only.**"

This would give me access to the correct Developer Central console where I can create a private application and configure its OAuth Redirect URI.

Instead, my account appears to be locked into the workflow for public developers who build apps for the Appstore, which is incorrect for my needs.

**Could you please take the following action:**

Please review my developer profile and re-categorize it as a **Private Developer** so that I can access the correct Developer Central page (`https://sellercentral.amazon.com/sellingpartner/developerconsole`) and create a private, self-authorized application.

Thank you for your assistance.
